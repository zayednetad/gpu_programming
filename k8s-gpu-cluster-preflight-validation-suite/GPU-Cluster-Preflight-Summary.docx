# GPU Cluster Preflight Validation Summary

## Introduction
This document summarizes the preflight validation checks for a GPU cluster, ensuring that all necessary configurations and setups are correctly implemented before deployment.

## Hardware Requirements
- **GPU Type**: Specify the GPU models (e.g., NVIDIA A100, V100)
- **Node Count**: Minimum and maximum nodes required
- **Memory**: Minimum GPU memory requirements per node

## Software Requirements
- **CUDA Version**: Required version of CUDA
- **NVIDIA Drivers**: Minimum driver version required for the selected GPUs
- **Library Dependencies**: List of libraries/packages needed for GPU applications

## Configuration Checks
1. **CUDA Installation**: Verify that CUDA is correctly installed on all nodes.
2. **NVIDIA Driver Version**: Check the installed NVIDIA driver version.
3. **kubelet Configuration**: Ensure that kubelet is configured to manage GPU resources properly.
4. **Pod Specification**: Validate pod specifications to ensure they request appropriate GPU resources.

## Testing Steps
- Run sample GPU workloads to confirm node configurations.
- Monitor GPU utilization during workload execution.

## Conclusion
Completing this preflight validation will ensure that your GPU cluster is properly configured for optimal performance before going into production.
